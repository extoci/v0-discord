# v0 Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot that interacts with [v0](https://v0.dev) via the [v0 SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v0-sdk) through Discord.

This is only really a proof of concept (for now ðŸ‘€) and is not meant to be used in production. This app is bootstrapped with `create-discord-bot` by the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) team.

## Setup

Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token
APPLICATION_ID=your-application-id
V0_API_KEY=your-v0-api-key
ACTIVE_CHANNEL_ID=your-active-channel-id # this is the channel where the bot will be active and generate projects every time it's mentioned
```

Get a Discord token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Get your v0 API key [here](https://v0.dev/chat/settings/keys).

3. Run `bun install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

Run `bun run start` to start the bot & send any message in the active channel to generate a v0 project.

## Todo

- [ ] Add follow-up prompts
- [ ] Vercel integration for production deployments
- [ ] Show the model's output in Discord, not just the URL
